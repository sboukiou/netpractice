# :mag: Description:
```
    This project is about managaing and configuring templates pre-defined
    small networks using subnetting skills and (Tcp/IP) addressing
```

# :hammer: Instructions:

```bash
    # To get started with the project you need to have its appropriate resources
    # available on the project page in the intranet
    # * Open a file manager and double-click the index.html file
    # * or:
        cd ./assets/
        python3 -m http.server
        # and then go to a web browser and type: localhost:<port-number-given-in-the-output>
        # (The port is usually 8000)
```
